# Prox-ROT

Code for Structured Transforms Across Spaces using Optimal Transport, AISTATS 2024 (Othmane Sebbouh, Marco Cuturi, Gabriel Peyr√©)

It is possible to either run the experiments from scratch, or see the figures in the ``precomputed_figures`` folder.

## Running the experiments from scratch

- For the experiments generating figure 1 and figure 2, run the following commands:
```
python train.py -e spatial -ep runs
python moscot_lr.py
python moscot_lr_fast.py
python moscot_sinkhorn.py
```

## Generating the plots
Each plot can be run with the corresponding jupyter notebook ```visualize_#.ipynb``` notebook once the experiments are run.
